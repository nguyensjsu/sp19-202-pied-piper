### Alan
- XP Core Value: Communication
- This week was not as good as last week in terms of the degree of communication. Multiple group members had questions involving the process of dealing with merges, but there was a lack of communciation in terms of the platform being used to solve the issue. This partially was due to the assumption that changes were being made on either github desktop or command line, but many changes were done from the web.
- Thankfully, members were communicative in terms of resolving the issue after it was pushed, and ultimately the merge issues were fixed with a reverting of code.
- Overall, the communication level was not as high as last week, but still strong in the end. Members were available on slack, text, and wechat.
