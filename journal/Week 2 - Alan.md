### Alan
- XP Core Value: Communication
- This week was very productive in terms of member contribution for the planning stage of our project. In an orderly fashion, each member was able to contribute ideas for a potential project that we could all agree upon; communication was emphasized.
- Ultimately, the scope of the project was narrowed down to being a game, and specifically a puzzle type of game. Controls were debated upon, and the idea of a "snake" based game was decided upon. Consequently, members contributed their ideas as to how to make the game stand out, and how to add elements of uniqueness.
- Overall, the value of communication was superb, and will continue to due so for next week.
