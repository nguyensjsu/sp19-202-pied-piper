### Finished Last Week 
- Task1: Finished implement observer pattern for score board, and drew some diagrams.
- Task2: Finished implement factory pattern to get the different score image, since there are three board.


### Planned Next Week 
- Task1: Continue to use observer pattern to make snake longer after he ate something, and change color etc to make game more beautiful.
- Task2: Draw some use case diagrams and activity diagrams. 

### Problems
Can't merge into master because of conflicts, but it's easy to solve, since I saw the conflicts are: define some variables and import some java
package that didn't exit.
### Time Spend

- Task1: 4 hrs
- Task2: 4 hrs

- XP Core Value: Communication
- This time I speak more in the group because I have a more clear view of the whole project and figured out what I should do last week. I also
share me problems(merge conflicts) and give some advice to help team member how to fix some problems. What's mroe I tried to  take more responsibility
for helping the whole team, since I think my part are not very hard(already figured out how greenfoot run this time), so I asked to draw some diagrams for the project..
