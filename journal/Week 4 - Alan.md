### Alan
- XP Core Value: Communication
- Again, this week was lacking in the level of expected communication. Merge issues were not a problem this week, but response times were generally slow, and many oversights in a lack of project knowledge made it very clear that members did not have the same idea about aspects of the components.
- I clearly delineated any issues regarding the expected working of the project, but there was a lack of retaining this information in regards to a couple team members. In short, the project displays a lack of quality in some aspects which do not look nearly as polished as other components.
- Overall, the communication level was lower than it should be for the final home stretch of the project.
