## Jake (Ilsoo) Kim
- XP Core Value: Feedback
- The game development is almost finished. So, we can do the tests. During the tests, we found some bugs and errors.
  For example, when snake dead, it called two times of death() methods and it makes record name and a score twice. 
  Team members gave feedback to each other and it helps to continue fix bugs.
