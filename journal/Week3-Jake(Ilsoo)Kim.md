## Jake (Ilsoo) Kim
- XP Core Value: Simplicity
- I tried to make Leaderboard with Composite Pattern and also tried to make it simple.
- I use composite pattern and each user has the component of user icon, name, and score. 
- When I will add more function later, since my pattern and way to develop is clear and simple, it will be easy to continue to work.
