## HaoRan Chen

- XP Core Value: Courage
- Even though it's not my first time being in a group, but I still feel a little bit nervous, and during the meeting, I think I am kind of lost
and I feel a little bit embrassed, if I interrupt the meeting, so I asked team member after the meeting, maybe next time I can do better.
