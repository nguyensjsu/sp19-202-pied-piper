## Jake (Ilsoo) Kim
- XP Core Value: Communication
- Every team member is new for each other, we started to talking from greeting.
We decided that what we'll make. Every members gave ideas for project and we decided to making a snake game.
Each member expressed their idea about pattern which is related with the Snake Game.
- In addition, make a meeting regularly is important for early stage of projects. We will have regular meeting, also we share our idea quickly every time through using Slack. We will continue to talk with diverse way.
